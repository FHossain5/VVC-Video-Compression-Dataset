# Volumetric Video dataset dynamic background

## Introduction
This guide walks you through the steps of creating a volumetric video using **Blender**, a free and open-source 3D creation suite. Volumetric videos capture the full 3D geometry of a scene or object, allowing for a more immersive experience. 

## Prerequisites
- **Blender**: Download and install the latest version of Blender from the [official website](https://www.blender.org/download/).
- **Polygon (.PLY) Files**: These files contain the 3D data, including points and color information, necessary for constructing the volumetric representation.

## Steps to Create a Volumetric Video

### 1. Setting Up Blender

1. **Launch Blender and Start a New Project**:
   - Change the Render Engine to **Cycles** for high-quality rendering.
     - Go to the **Properties panel** on the right side of the screen.
     - Click on the **Render Properties tab** (camera icon).
     - Under **Render Engine**, select **Cycles**.

2. **Import Your .PLY File**:
   - Go to `File > Import > Stanford (.ply)`.
   - Navigate to your file location, select the `.PLY` file, and click **Import**.
   - Note: The model may not be immediately visible in the viewport, which will be addressed in the next steps.

### 2. Creating Materials

1. **Go to the Shading Workspace**:
   - Click on the **Shading** tab at the top of the Blender interface.

2. **Create a New Material for Your Model**:
   - In the **Shader Editor**, click **New** to create a new material.
   - Name the material for easy identification, especially if working with multiple objects.

3. **Add a Color Attributes Node**:
   - Press `Shift + A` to bring up the **Add** menu, then navigate to **Input > Attribute**.
   - Place the **Attribute** node in the shader editor.
   - In the **Attribute** node, type `Col` (short for Color) in the **Name** field to pull in the color data from the `.PLY` file.

4. **Connect the Color Attribute**:
   - Connect the **Color output** of the **Attribute** node to the **Base Color input** of the material's **Principled BSDF** shader. This applies the color information stored in your `.PLY` file to the model.

### 3. Working with Geometry Nodes

1. **Switch to the Geometry Nodes Workspace**:
   - Click on the **Geometry Nodes** tab at the top of Blender.

2. **Create a New Geometry Node Tree**:
   - Click **New** to start a new node tree.

3. **Add a Mesh to Points Node**:
   - Press `Shift + A` and go to **Geometry > Mesh to Points**.
   - Place the **Mesh to Points** node between the **Group Input** and **Group Output** nodes in the node editor.
   - This node converts the mesh into points, essential for the volumetric representation.

4. **Configure the Mesh to Points Node**:
   - Ensure that the **Points output** is connected to the **Group Output** node. You should now see your model as a point cloud in the viewport.

### 4. Applying Materials in Geometry Nodes

1. **Add a Set Material Node**:
   - Press `Shift + A` and navigate to **Material > Set Material**.
   - Place the **Set Material** node between the **Mesh to Points** node and the **Group Output** node.

2. **Assign the Material**:
   - In the **Set Material** node, choose the material you created earlier from the dropdown menu. This will apply the material, including the color data, to the points.

3. **Adjust Settings as Necessary**:
   - Tweak the material properties, point size, and other settings to refine the appearance of your model.

### 5. Finalizing and Rendering

1. **Set Up Your Scene**:
   - Position cameras, lights, and any other elements you'd like to include in your scene.
   - Use Blender's tools to animate the camera or the model if your volumetric video requires movement.

2. **Prepare for Rendering**:
   - Go to the **Render Properties** tab and adjust settings such as **Samples**, **Denoising**, and **Output Resolution** to balance quality and render time.

3. **Render the Video**:
   - Once everything is set up, go to `Render > Render Animation` to start rendering your video.
   - Blender will render each frame of your animation, which you can compile into a video file.

## Conclusion
By following this guide, you can create high-quality volumetric videos using Blender. The flexibility of Blender's tools allows you to adjust and experiment with different settings to achieve the desired effect. Whether you're creating static models or fully animated scenes, this process provides a solid foundation for volumetric video creation.
