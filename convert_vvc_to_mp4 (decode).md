To convert a VVC (Versatile Video Coding) file to an MP4 file

### Steps to Convert VVC to MP4

1. **Decode the VVC File to YUV Format**
   - **Tool**: Use a decoder that supports VVC, such as [VVdeC](https://github.com/fraunhoferhhi/vvdec).
   - **Command**:
     ```bash
     vvdecapp -b input.vvc -o output.yuv
     ```
     - `input.vvc`: The path to your VVC file.
     - `output.yuv`: The output file in YUV format.

2. **Encode YUV to MP4**
   - **Tool**: Use FFmpeg to encode the YUV file to MP4 format.
   - **Command**:
     ```bash
     ffmpeg -s <resolution> -pix_fmt <pixel_format> -i output.yuv -c:v libx264 output.mp4
     ```
     - `<resolution>`: Specify the resolution of the YUV file (e.g., `1920x1080`).
     - `<pixel_format>`: Specify the pixel format of the YUV file (e.g., `yuv420p`).
     - `libx264`: This is the codec for encoding video to H.264, which is widely supported in MP4 containers.

### Example Workflow

1. **Step 1: Decode VVC to YUV**
   ```bash
   vvdecapp -b input.vvc -o output.yuv
   ```
   This command will decode the VVC file `input.vvc` to raw YUV video data `output.yuv`.

2. **Step 2: Convert YUV to MP4**
   ```bash
   ffmpeg -s 1920x1080 -pix_fmt yuv420p -i output.yuv -c:v libx264 output.mp4
   ```
   This command will take the raw YUV data and convert it into an MP4 file with H.264 encoding.


### Tools Required:
- **VVdeC**: VVC decoder (e.g., `vvdecapp`).
- **FFmpeg**: For encoding YUV to MP4.

### Notes:
- Ensure that you have both VVdeC and FFmpeg installed and accessible from your command line or terminal.
- Adjust the resolution (`-s`) and pixel format (`-pix_fmt`) according to your YUV file specifics.

This workflow allows you to convert VVC files to MP4 format using widely available tools.
